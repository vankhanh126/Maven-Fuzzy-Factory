# BUSINESS GROWTH ANALYSIS OF SIMULATED COMPANY: MAVEN FUZZY FACTORY
Maven Fuzzy Factory: SQL-driven business growth analysis project showcasing data analysis skills. This project is intended for personal use.

# Description
This project analysed a fictional online retailer called 'Maven Fuzzy Factory' over a three-year period using a simulated database. The goal was to understand the company's growth and gain practical business insights.

We explored Maven Fuzzy Factory's operations, tracking things like sales, customer behaviour, and finances. The data revealed trends and patterns that gave us insights into the company's market position, customer strategies, revenue, and efficiency. We presented these findings using reports and visuals.

While Maven Fuzzy Factory is imaginary, this project demonstrates how data analysis can provide real-world insights.
